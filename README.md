# Secure Local Password Generator

This password generator is designed with **privacy and security** in mind. All password generation and storage happen **entirely on your local machine**, ensuring that your sensitive data is never transmitted online or stored on any external server.

## Key Features:

### 1. **No Server-Side Processing**
- The generator operates **100% locally** on your computer.
- None of your passwords, usernames, or application details are ever sent to a server or stored on the cloud.
- All data remains on your device, providing full control and privacy over your information.

### 2. **Local Encryption**
- All passwords are encrypted using **industry-standard encryption** before being saved to a file.
- The encryption key is derived from a master password that **only you know**, ensuring that your saved passwords are secure.
- Both the encryption and decryption of passwords are handled **entirely on your device**.

### 3. **Offline Functionality**
- The application can run in **offline mode**, meaning it does not require an internet connection to function. 
- This guarantees that no data is ever transmitted over the internet, providing complete privacy.

### 4. **Self-Contained `.exe`**
- The generated `.exe` file is **completely self-contained**, meaning users do not need to install Python or any additional dependencies.
- Once compiled, the program runs independently and securely without requiring external libraries or connections.

### 6. **Network Security**
- You can use a firewall or network monitoring tool to verify that the program **does not attempt to connect to the internet** or any external servers.
- The program performs no network operations whatsoeverâ€”**everything is handled locally**.

## How It Works:
1. Upon first launch, the program asks you to set a **master password**, which is used to encrypt and decrypt your saved passwords.
2. Passwords are generated locally and stored in an encrypted file on your machine, accessible only with your master password.
3. The program runs completely offline, ensuring that your data stays on your machine and **never leaves your local environment**.
